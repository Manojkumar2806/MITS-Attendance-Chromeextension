    B --> C[Smart Calculations]  
    C --> D[Visual Analytics]
    D --> E[Insights & Recommendations]

```

### 🧠 Core Algorithm

```
  `Percentage = (Total Classes Attended / Total Classes Conducted) × 100`  
  `Recovery Needed = Math.ceil((0.75 × Total Classes - Attended Classes) / 0.25)`  
  `Status = Percentage ≥ 75 ? "Safe" : "Needs Improvement"`  
```
